Java Textualyser
================

Java Textualyser is a Java based text analyser that outputs simple statistics about the 'style' of prose of text files.

This project originated as a piece of coursework that I did during my Computer Science degree at the University of Surrey. I have since been working on it for fun in my spare time, and so the code has gradually evolved from it's original form.

This is not a mature project. I am still learning how to best use Java practices to improve this program, so it is by no means guaranteed to be bug-free.
