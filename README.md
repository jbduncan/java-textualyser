Notice
================
This project is inactive. I've decided to keep it on GitHub to demonstrate what sort of programming skills I had during my first and second years at university.

Java Textualyser
================
Java Textualyser is a Java based text analyser that outputs simple statistics about the 'style' of prose of text files.

This project originated as a piece of coursework that I did during my first year of my Computer Science degree, and it's been slowly evolving from it's original form over time.

This is not a mature project. I am still learning how to best use Java practices to improve this program, so it is by no means guaranteed to be bug-free.

Java Textualyser is distributed under the permissive MIT licence. Please see LICENCE.txt for more details.
