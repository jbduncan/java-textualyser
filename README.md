Java Textualyser
================

Java Textualyser is a Java based text analyser that gets simple statistics about the 'style' of prose of text files.

This project originated as a piece of coursework I did during the first year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Surrey. It has since evolved into something coded more elaborately, which I have been working on for fun in my spare time.

This software is by no means a finished project. I am still learning how to best use Java practices to make this program work as intended, so it is by no means guaranteed to be bug-free.
